<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![JoviToken](images/screenshot.png)](https://jovitokenico.joviandsouza.repl.co/)

JoviToken is an ERC20 based token currently deployed on the Ethereum Goerli testnetwork. This token is for learning purposes only. ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens created using the Ethereum blockchain. A fungible token is one that is interchangeable with another token. This repo includes the Smart Contract files for the Presale and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for JoviToken. This also includes the unit testing files for the solidity smart contracts.

For ICO Website ðŸ’» implementation follow [JoviTokenIco-contracts](https://github.com/Jovian-Dsouza/JoviTokenICO)

Here are some cool features of this crowdsale:

* Minted Crowdsale : Instead of having  a fixed supply the tokens are minted according to the total purchase
* Capped Crowdsale : adds a cap to your crowdsale, invalidating any purchases that would exceed that cap
* Individually Capped Crowdsale : Caps an individual's contributions
* Timed Crowdale : Allows buying of token in a certain time interval only
* Refundable Crowdale : Refunds the buyer if the Goal is not reached
* Token Time Vesting and Token Distribution
* Testcases to make sure that the smart contract is working correctly
